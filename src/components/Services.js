                        We are a certified home kitchen in Quincy California.I hope you have some great memories of
                        homemade
                        baked goods, where the scent of fresh-baked bread or chocolate chip cookies came from a kitchen
                        with
                        people who loved and cared about you.
                        I hope that you feel that way with every order you receive from Ramâ€™s Bakery.
